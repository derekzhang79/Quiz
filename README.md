# QuizApp

This is my take at online quiz program. After you have completed a quiz,
you'll get an unique code that can be used to claim that you did the test

My teacher wants me to create this so I did. Now seems that he no longer use it
and my friends are creating their own quiz apps so I'm open source mine.

This is also my first Django project ever. I do not intend to maintain it any more.
